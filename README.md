Mozilla add-on to help send files to friends 

## Work-flow and features:
1. Sign-up using email-ID and password.
2. Login to add-on from multiple devices.
3. Upload file (Google Drive/Mozilla send) and send link to friends.
4. Friends to be found and contacted using Email
5. Database to store information about user, friends, files and other messages.
6. Messaging feature.
7. Single View messages and documents... Automatically deleted once viewed.


## Tentative features:
1. Notification when someone sent a file
2. Group and sending to multiple people (only possible using Google Drive)
3. Try to implement ShareIt functionality... Direct packet to packet transfer without storing anything on server.
4. One download or Time based restriction for file availablity
5. Maybe something else also :P
